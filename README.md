Pure-Rust Apple QuickTime File Format (QTFF) demuxer + muxer.

QTFF is the immediate ancestor of ISO Base Media File Format
(ISO/IEC 14496-12); MP4 is itself an ISO BMFF derivative. The two
share an atom/box hierarchy, but QTFF retains Apple-specific semantics
ISO BMFF does not standardise. This crate is the **dedicated container
for QTFF inputs** and is a sibling — not a child — of
[`oxideav-mp4`]. It also reads and writes the ISO BMFF feature set
shared with MP4 / fMP4 / DASH / CMAF, so QuickTime-only and ISO-only
boxes both surface (with QuickTime-only fields staying empty on `.mov`
and ISO-only fields staying empty on `.mov`).

Decoding stays in codec crates: this crate calls
`oxideav_core::CodecResolver` to map sample-description FourCCs to
`CodecId`s and never opens a decoder itself.

## Demuxer

- Atom walker over `[size:4][type:4]([ext_size:8])?[payload]` with
  `size==1` (extended 64-bit) and `size==0` (to-EOF) special cases.
- `ftyp` / `styp` brand detection (`qt  `, plus the DASH / CMAF
  segment-brand predicates); `pdin`, `sidx`, `ssix`, `prft`, `pnot`,
  `ctab` at file scope; user-type (`uuid`) vendor-extension capture.
- `moov` walk: `mvhd` (incl. the movie display matrix with a
  `rotation()` classifier and the QuickTime preview / poster /
  selection / current time fields), per-track `tkhd` / `mdia`
  (`mdhd`, `hdlr`) / `minf/stbl`, plus the QuickTime `clip` / `crgn`,
  `matt` / `kmat`, `load`, `imap`, and Color Table atoms.
- Sample tables: `stsd`, `stts`, `stsc`, `stsz` / `stz2` (compact),
  `stco` / `co64`, `stss`, `stsh` (shadow sync), `sdtp`, `stdp`,
  `padb`, `subs` (sub-samples), `saiz` / `saio` (sample-aux), and
  sample groups (`sbgp` / `sgpd` v0/v1/v2 plus the compact `csgp`)
  with typed per-sample lookups for every standardized §10 grouping
  type — `'roll'` / `'prol'` / `'rap '` (random-access), `'tele'`
  (temporal level), `'sap '` (Stream Access Point), `'rash'`
  (rate share), and `'alst'` (alternative startup sequence).
- QuickTime Metadata atom (`moov/meta`, `trak/meta` — QTFF 2012
  pp. 129 – 143) in full: `hdlr` (`mdta`), `mhdr` next-item-id, `ctry` /
  `lang` localization list sets, `keys`, and every `ilst` item with its
  `itif` id, `name`, and all locale-tagged `data` values
  (`QtMetadata`; well-known types 0 – 28 decode; p. 140 locale
  matching via `value_for_locale`). The flat `meta` list keeps the
  first-value-per-key view. The muxer writes the same surface
  (`MovMetaItem` values with countries / languages → derived `ctry` /
  `lang` lists, `itif` + `mhdr`, `name`).
- Per-sample iterator yielding `(index, file_offset, size, dts,
  duration, sample_description_id, keyframe)`, plus a random-access
  surface (`chunk_for_sample`, `sample_offset`, `chunk_byte_extent`, …)
  implementing QTFF "Finding a Sample" without iterating prior samples.
- Edit lists (`edts/elst`): `movie_pts_for` / `media_pts_for` map
  between media- and movie-timescale PTS, handling empty / dwell /
  composition-shift edits and non-unity `media_rate`. By default
  `next_packet` keeps the media-time PTS contract; opt-in
  `apply_edit_lists(true)` **applies** the edit list to packet timing
  (QTFF pp. 46–48 / §8.6.6) — samples outside every edit are dropped,
  timestamps move onto the edited presentation timeline (still in the
  stream's media timescale), rate-N segments scale spacing and
  durations, dwells stretch their held sample, and a mid-sample trim
  clamps the final duration. Per-sample mapping surfaces via
  `edited_timing_for` / `edit::edited_timing_for_sample`
  (`EditedTiming { pts, dts, duration }`), validated against an
  ffprobe black-box oracle. Opt-in `emit_never_presented(true)` keeps
  decode-only media (trimmed heads/tails a presented frame depends on,
  priming audio) instead of dropping it: such samples emit
  **discard-flagged** with timing extrapolated from the nearest
  presenting segment (negative edited pts for head trims), and an
  edited seek landing on a never-presented sync sample reports its
  extrapolated dts. Typed list surface: `parse_elst_full` (`Elst`
  preserves the FullBox version/flags), `Track::elst_version`, and the
  summary accessors `edit_start_delay` / `edit_media_start` /
  `edit_total_duration` — all mappers saturate on hostile 64-bit
  elst fields.
- Track relationships: typed `tref` accessors for every QTFF reference
  kind (`chap`, `tmcd`, `sync`, `scpt`, `hint`, `ssrc`) plus the ISO
  BMFF §8.3.3.3 reference types `cdsc` (content-describes), `font`,
  `hind` (hint dependency), `vdep` / `vplx` (auxiliary depth / parallax
  video), `subt`, and the QTFF 2012-08-14 `folw` Subtitle Follows
  (a sound track's default-subtitle pointer within its alternate
  group) — with track-id → index resolvers; `tsel`
  (track selection / switch groups),
  `kind`, `trgr` (track groups), and `strk` sub-tracks. `tkhd` flags
  + `alternate_group` surfaced via `presentation_tracks()` /
  `alternate_groups()` / `switch_groups()`.
- Video sample-description extensions: `gama`, `pasp`, `clap`, `colr`,
  `fiel` (field handling), and the default Motion-JPEG `mjqt` / `mjht`
  tables (surfaced verbatim).
- Timecode tracks (`tmcd`): the `stsd` sample description (time scale /
  frame duration / frames-per-second / drop-frame-etc flags / structured
  source-tape `name` per QTFF p. 224) plus per-sample **Timecode Sample
  Data** decoding (QTFF p. 108) — `timecode_sample(track, idx)` reads a
  sample's `mdat` payload into either a 32-bit tape `Counter` value or a
  packed `[H:M:S:F]` `Record` (with sign), and `start_timecode(track)`
  resolves a media track's governing timecode through its `tref/tmcd`
  reference. `TimecodeRecord::to_frames` / `from_frames` give
  non-drop-frame conversions (drop-frame absolute counts are out of
  scope — the SMPTE-12M skip rule is outside the QTFF spec).
- QuickTime Text Sample Description (`text` format inside `stsd` on a
  classic `text`-handler track, QTFF pp. 108–110): the display config of
  a QuickTime text track is decoded into a typed `TextSampleDescription`
  on `SampleDescription::text` — `display_flags` (drop-shadow / anti-alias
  / scroll / key-text / use-movie-background, surfaced via accessors),
  `text_justification` (left / center / right), the 48-bit RGB
  fore/background colours (`Rgb48`), the `default_text_box` rectangle, the
  `font_number` / `font_face` style bitmask (bold / italic / underline /
  …), and the trailing Pascal font `text_name`. Distinct from the
  per-sample text payload decoded by `parse_text_sample_styles` and from
  the `gmhd/text` media-information header. Non-`text` handlers leave the
  field `None`.
- Sound sample-description versioning: version-0 (uncompressed-sample),
  version-1 (QTFF p. 101 `SoundDescriptionV1`) and version-2
  (QTFF 2012-08-14 pp. 181–182 `SoundDescriptionV2`) layouts. The four
  fixed-ratio fields (`samples_per_packet`, `bytes_per_packet`,
  `bytes_per_frame`, `bytes_per_sample`) surface typed via
  [`SoundV1`]; `audio_version` + `audio_compression_id` are exposed,
  and `is_vbr()` decodes the variable-bit-rate "third variant"
  (version 1, Compression ID `-2`, QTFF p. 102). The QuickTime-7
  high-resolution v2 form (`lpcm` uncompressed / `mp4a`-style
  compressed) surfaces typed via [`SoundV2`] — Float64
  `audio_sample_rate` (rates past the 16.16 field's 65535 Hz cap),
  32-bit `num_audio_channels`, the constant-if-nonzero
  bits/bytes/frames-per-packet descriptors, and the `lpcm`
  `format_specific_flags` decoded by [`LpcmFlags`] (float /
  endianness / signed / packed / aligned-high / non-interleaved /
  non-mixable / all-clear bits, the fixed-point sample-fraction
  field, and the Apple Lossless source-depth codes) — with
  extension atoms located via `sizeOfStructOnly` (hostile offsets
  fall back safely) and `audio_sample_rate_hz()` picking the best
  available rate source. The ISO BMFF side
  (§12.2.3/§12.2.4) is read too: an `AudioSampleEntryV1` in a
  version-1 `stsd` (same 20-byte fixed body, no QTFF extension) sets
  `iso_audio_entry_v1`, with the `srat` SamplingRateBox
  (`effective_sample_rate()` override) and the `chnl` ChannelLayout
  (defined ISO/IEC 23001-8 configuration + omitted-channels map, or
  explicit per-channel speaker positions, plus object counts)
  surfaced typed. The Apple `chan`
  channel layout is parsed, and the QTFF 2012-08-14 sound-description
  extension atoms decode typed: `wave` siDecompressionParam
  (required for `mp4a`; `frma` / `esds` / Terminator children with
  `format()` / `esds()` accessors, non-atom `WAVEFORMATEX`-style
  payloads kept verbatim), a directly-carried `esds`, the deprecated
  `flap` siSlopeAndIntercept record, and the `0x00000000` Terminator
  atom — write-side inverses (`SiDecompressionParam::to_atom_bytes`,
  `WaveChild` builders, `build_esds_atom`) plug into a muxer track's
  `extra_stsd_atoms`. Elementary-stream-descriptor *contents* stay
  opaque for the codec crates.
- Timed-metadata sample entries (ISO/IEC 14496-12 §12.3.3): a `meta`-
  handler track's `stsd` entry (`Hdlr::is_metadata()`) is decoded into a
  typed `MetadataSampleEntry` on `SampleDescription::metadata` — `metx`
  (XML: `content_encoding` / `namespace` / `schema_location`), `mett`
  (text: `content_encoding` / `mime_format` plus the `txtC` TextConfigBox
  `text_config`), and `urim` (URI: the `uri ` URIBox string plus the
  optional `uriI` URIInitBox data). The optional `btrt` BitRateBox
  (§8.5.2.2) is decoded to `BitRate { buffer_size_db, max_bitrate,
  avg_bitrate }` and surfaced via `MetadataSampleEntry::bitrate()`.
- Timed-text simple sample entry (ISO/IEC 14496-12 §12.5.3): a `text`-
  handler track's `stsd` entry whose FourCC is `stxt` is decoded into a
  typed `SimpleTextSampleEntry` on `SampleDescription::simple_text` —
  `content_encoding` / `mime_format` plus the optional `btrt` BitRateBox
  and `txtC` TextConfigBox. Selected by the `stxt` FourCC, so it coexists
  on the same `text` handler with the QuickTime `text` description above.
- Subtitle sample entries (ISO/IEC 14496-12 §12.6.3): a `subt`-handler
  track's `stsd` entry (`Hdlr::is_subtitle()`) is decoded into a typed
  `SubtitleSampleEntry` on `SampleDescription::subtitle` — `stpp`
  (XML: `namespace` / `schema_location` / `auxiliary_mime_types`) and
  `sbtt` (text: `content_encoding` / `mime_format` + `txtC`), sharing
  the `btrt` BitRateBox decoding.
- Hint tracks (`hdlr.is_hint()`): the Hint Media Header Box (`hmhd`,
  ISO/IEC 14496-12 §12.4.2) is decoded into `Hmhd { max_pdu_size,
  avg_pdu_size, max_bitrate, avg_bitrate }` on `Track::hmhd`.
- Media-header classification (§8.4.5.1): every track records which
  media-header box its `minf` carried — `vmhd` / `smhd` / `hmhd` /
  `sthd` (Subtitle Media Header, §12.6.2) / `nmhd` (Null Media Header,
  §8.4.5.2, used by timed-metadata tracks) / `gmhd` — on
  `Track::media_header_kind` (`MediaHeaderKind`). The optional `elng`
  Extended Language Tag Box (§8.4.6) is parsed onto
  `Track::extended_language` (an RFC 4646 / BCP 47 tag such as
  `"en-US"` that overrides the packed `mdhd.language`).
- Fragmented MP4 / fMP4 / DASH: `mvex/trex` defaults +
  `moof/traf/tfhd/trun` cascade, `tfdt` baseline DTS, `leva` level
  assignment, and per-fragment sample-aux. `mfra/tfra/mfro`-driven
  fragmented seek (PTS-keyed binary search, linear fallback). The
  §8.8.7.1 base-data-offset modes resolve against each traf's
  **effective data reference** (`Tfhd::addressing()` classifies
  them): an explicit `base_data_offset` is "identical to a chunk
  offset" and so addresses the stream the effective `dref` entry
  designates — including a non-self (external) one, per §8.8.4.1's
  incremental-presentation allowance — while the moof-relative modes
  anchor at byte positions of the fragment's own file, so
  `default-base-is-moof` with a non-self entry is refused, an
  inheriting traf must use the same data reference as the traf whose
  data-end it inherits ("the data for these tracks must be in the
  same file"), and same-external-dref inheritance chains legally
  within the external file.
- Compressed movie resources (`cmov` / `dcom` / `cmvd`): zlib-inflated
  transparently on open (bounded by the declared uncompressed size),
  re-entering the same `moov` walk;
  `compressed_movie_algorithm` surfaces the `dcom` FourCC.
- Reference movies (`rmra/rmda/rmdr/rmcs`): parsed; alias resolution
  is opt-in (`open_with_aliases`) so the default `open` path can't
  reach the network / filesystem.
- External data references (`dinf/dref`, QTFF p. 94 / §8.7.2): by
  default a sample whose description points at a non-self `dref` entry
  yields a recoverable `Unsupported` error instead of silently emitting
  local bytes; local tracks in the same movie keep demuxing, and
  `sample_data_in_file` / `track_has_external_data` expose the
  classification. Opt-in **resolution** via
  `set_data_reference_opener`: the opener receives the typed
  `DataReference` (`url ` / `urn ` / `alis` / `rsrc`) and returns a
  reader over the external file; sample bytes are then read at their
  chunk-derived offsets within *that* file (QTFF pp. 79/113 — offsets
  address the data stream the data reference designates, so the
  external file may be any format at all, per the "Defining Media Data
  Layouts" appendix). At most one opener call per `(track, dref-entry)`
  — successes cache the reader, failures cache sticky per-sample
  recoverable errors. The built-in `dref_file_opener(base_dir)` is a
  sandboxed local-file policy: `file://` URLs, plus percent-decoded
  plain-relative names joined to the caller's base directory (no
  absolute paths, no `..` traversal, no drive/rooted shapes); foreign
  schemes and Macintosh alias records are rejected. Seek, applied edit
  lists, fragmented movies (`moof` sample offsets resolved per
  §8.8.7.1 land in the external file exactly like chunk offsets), and
  every layout compose with resolution; the default `open` still
  never touches the filesystem or network.

## Seek

`MovDemuxer::seek_to(stream, pts)` walks the per-track sample queue,
snaps to the largest sync (`stss`) sample at-or-before the target DTS,
and resets the cursor so the next `next_packet()` re-emits from there.
Fragmented files use `tfra` when present. With `apply_edit_lists(true)`
the input is an edited-timeline timestamp (resolved back to media time
via the edit list, clamping out-of-presentation targets) and the return
value is the edited dts of the first packet the mode will emit —
`edited_pts_to_media_pts` exposes the resolver.

## Muxer

`MovMuxer` emits a non-fragmented MOV/MP4
carrying one or more video / audio / time-code / text / timed-metadata /
subtitle / timed-text / hint tracks,
round-tripping through `MovDemuxer` with sample count, sizes, payloads,
and keyframe flags preserved. `stco` auto-promotes to `co64` when chunk offsets cross
4 GiB. Layout is configurable on both axes: `MoovPlacement`
(`AfterMdat` default, or `BeforeMdat` — the "faststart" web-playback
layout, QTFF p. 365, resolved by a fixed-point `moov` sizing pass and
classified by the demuxer's `is_faststart()`) and `ChunkStrategy`
(`SingleChunkPerTrack` default, or `InterleaveByMovieTicks` — the
QTFF p. 358 time-ordered interleave with run-length `stsc` and one
`stco`/`co64` entry per chunk). The registry write path is wired too:
`ContainerRegistry::open_muxer("mov", …)` returns a `Muxer`-trait
adapter that buffers packets, recovers durations from decode-time
deltas and `ctts` offsets from pts − dts, and maps codec identities to
case-correct QTFF sample-description FourCCs. Per-sample composition offsets (`MuxSample.composition_offset`,
PTS − DTS) emit a `ctts` Composition Time to Sample Box (§8.6.1.3):
omitted when every offset is zero, version 0 for an all-non-negative
track, auto-promoted to version 1 (signed `int(32)`) the moment any
offset is negative — so B-frame reorder round-trips PTS exactly. The
fragmented path applies the same policy per `trun` (§8.8.8.2
`sample_composition_time_offset`, per-run version/flag selection with
the all-zero run keeping the historical 12-byte-row wire shape), so
fragmented B-frame reorder — including on external-data tracks —
round-trips PTS too.
`auto_cslg(track_id)` / `set_cslg(track_id, Cslg)` add the matching
Composition to Decode Box (`cslg`, §8.6.1.4) right after the `ctts`:
`auto_cslg` derives the five bounds (`compositionToDTSShift`, least /
greatest `composition_offset`, composition start / end time) from the
track's per-sample offsets + durations; both auto-promote to v1 when a
field leaves the signed-32-bit range. Round-trips through `parse_cslg`
and satisfies the demuxer's `cslg`/`ctts` cross-validation.

- `set_edit_list(track_id, &[MuxEdit])` emits an `edts/elst` (QTFF
  p. 47 / §8.6.6) between `tkhd` and `mdia`. `MuxEdit::segment` is a
  unity-rate presentation segment; `MuxEdit::empty` is a head empty
  edit (`media_time == -1`) for encoder-priming-skip or start-delay;
  `MuxEdit::dwell` holds one frame (`media_rate == 0`, §8.6.6.3) and
  `MuxEdit::segment_with_rate` takes any positive 16.16 rate
  (negative rates rejected per QTFF p. 48).
  The `elst` auto-promotes from v0 (32-bit) to v1 (64-bit) the moment a
  `track_duration` exceeds 4 GiB-ticks or a `media_time` leaves the
  signed-32-bit range; entries round-trip through the read-side
  `parse_elst`. No `edts` is written when a track has no edit list.
  The fragmented path emits the same `edts` into the init-segment
  `trak`, so a fragmented presentation keeps its edits.
- `with_fragmentation(ByDuration | ByFrameCount)` +
  `encode_fragmented_to_vec()` emit a fragmented MP4 / fMP4 / DASH
  segment stream (init segment + one media segment per fragment).
  Opt-in `with_fragment_index()` appends the trailing `mfra` Movie
  Fragment Random Access Box (§8.8.9): one `tfra` per track indexing
  the first sync sample of each of its fragments (presentation time +
  moof offset + 1-based traf/trun/sample coordinates, per-box v0→v1
  auto-promotion past 32 bits, 4-byte-wide structural fields), closed
  by the `mfro` size trailer (§8.8.11) — so the demuxer's tfra-driven
  fragmented seek engages on our own output, external-data tracks
  included (a `tfra` locates samples structurally, independent of
  where their bytes live). Opt-in `with_fragment_decode_times()`
  emits a `tfdt` (§8.8.12) in every `traf` — the absolute
  `baseMediaDecodeTime` of its first sample, v0→v1 auto-promotion —
  so a media segment stays correctly timed when decoded without its
  predecessors (the streaming mid-stream-join shape). Opt-in
  `with_fragment_total_duration()` opens the init `mvex` with a
  `mehd` (§8.8.2) declaring the longest track's total duration in
  movie ticks (computable exactly — every sample is supplied up
  front).
- `set_sample_aux(track_id, SampleAuxStream)` writes `saiz` / `saio`
  on both the non-fragmented (`stbl`-scope, absolute offset) and
  fragmented (`traf`-scope, moof-relative offset) paths — e.g. for
  Common Encryption per-sample records.
- `add_sample_to_group(track_id, SampleToGroupWrite)` writes a `csgp`
  (CompactSampleToGroupBox, ISO/IEC 14496-12:2020 §8.9.5) per
  `grouping_type` at `stbl` scope. The per-sample group-description
  indices are run-length-encoded into the compact pattern form (one
  `pattern_length == 1` pattern per run) with minimum-width field
  selectors; the `parse_csgp` read path expands them back to the exact
  per-sample assignment. `add_sample_to_group_with_form(…,
  SampleGroupBoxForm::Classic)` instead writes the widely-compatible
  run-length `sbgp` (SampleToGroupBox, §8.9.2) — same mapping, the form
  every ISO BMFF reader understands (round-trips through `parse_sbgp`).
- `set_sample_group_description(track_id, SampleGroupDescriptionWrite)`
  writes the sibling `sgpd` (SampleGroupDescriptionBox, §8.9.3) that a
  `csgp`/`sbgp`'s indices reference — without it a non-zero index points
  at nothing. Written version 1 (constant `default_length` when entries
  are uniform, else a per-entry `description_length` prefix), before the
  `sbgp`/`csgp` boxes per §8.9.3 ordering. Typed §10 entry constructors
  (`roll_entry` / `prol_entry` / `rap_entry` / `tele_entry` /
  `sap_entry`) mirror the read-side decoders; round-trips through
  `parse_sgpd`.
- `set_metadata(&[MovMetadata])` (movie scope, `moov/udta`) and
  `set_track_metadata(track_id, &[MovMetadata])` (track scope,
  `trak/udta`) emit a User Data Box (QTFF pp. 36–38 / §8.10.1).
  `MovMetadata::intl_text` writes an Apple international-text record
  (`©XXX`); same-FourCC items coalesce into one atom carrying one
  per-language record (set `UTF8_INTL_TEXT_FLAG | iso_language(tag)` for
  a UTF-8 body, a Mac language code for Mac-Roman). `plain_utf8`
  (`name` / `auth` / `cprt`) and `raw` (opaque FourCC) cover the QT-7+
  and unknown shapes. All round-trip through `parse_udta` and surface on
  `MovDemuxer::user_data` / `Track::user_data`.
- `set_apple_metadata(&[MovMetaItem])` emits the modern Apple **QuickTime
  Metadata** box (`moov/meta` = `hdlr` `mdta` + `keys` + `ilst`), distinct from
  the legacy `udta` above. Each `MovMetaItem` becomes one `keys` declaration
  (`[namespace][key]`, namespace defaulting to `mdta`) paired with one `ilst`
  entry whose `data` sub-atom carries the typed value: `MovMetaItem::utf8`
  (type-code 1), `::signed_int` (type-code 21, 32-bit BE), or `::typed` for an
  explicit namespace / type-indicator / raw bytes. Duplicate keys each get their
  own `keys`/`ilst` slot; the 1-based `ilst` key-index references the matching
  `keys` row, so the read-side `parse_keys` / `parse_ilst` resolve every item
  back onto `MovDemuxer::meta` (namespace / key / type-code / value preserved).
  Coexists with `udta` when both are set; no `meta` box when empty.
  `set_track_apple_metadata(track_id, &[MovMetaItem])` does the same at track
  scope (`trak/meta`, surfacing on `Track::meta`); movie and track scopes are
  independent.
- `set_visual_extensions(track_id, VisualExtensions)` attaches the typed
  visual sample-description extension boxes to a **video** track (ISO/IEC
  14496-12 §12.1.4 / §12.1.5, QTFF p. 94): `pasp` (Pixel Aspect Ratio),
  `colr` (Colour Information — Apple `nclc` / ISO `nclx` with the
  `full_range_flag` top bit / ICC / `Other`), `clap` (Clean Aperture, with
  signed `horiz_off_n` / `vert_off_n`), `fiel` (Field Handling), and `gama`
  (a 16.16 fixed-point gamma). Each populated `VisualExtensions` field
  emits its box into the video `stsd` entry's trailing slot — after the
  70-byte fixed body and after the codec-config `extra_stsd_atoms`, so a
  decoder-config box (`avcC` / `hvcC`) stays first — in a stable canonical
  order (`colr`, `pasp`, `clap`, `fiel`, `gama`). The new
  `Pasp`/`Clap`/`ColorParameters`/`Fiel` `to_body_bytes` serialisers are
  the exact inverses of the read-side `parse_*` decoders, so the file
  round-trips through the demuxer's `scan_video_extensions` back onto
  `SampleDescription`'s `pasp` / `colr` / `clap` / `fiel` / `gamma`. An
  empty set writes nothing; a non-video track or unknown `track_id` is
  rejected.
- `set_track_references(track_id, &[TrackReference])` emits a `tref`
  (Track Reference Box, QTFF p. 50 / §8.3.3) between a track's
  `tkhd`/`edts` and its `mdia`, one child atom per reference type
  (FourCC = relationship, body = packed `u32` referenced track ids).
  `TrackReference::chapter(id)` / `::timecode(id)` / `::to(type, id)`
  cover the common cases (`chap`, `tmcd`, `sync`, `scpt`, `cdsc`, …);
  every referenced id is validated against the tracks added so far
  (self-references allowed). Round-trips through `parse_tref` onto
  `Track::references` and the typed `chapter_track_ref` /
  `timecode_track_ref` / `timecode_track_index` accessors.
- `MuxTrackKind::Timecode { description, tcmi }` writes a full QTFF
  time-code track (QTFF pp. 106–116): a `tmcd`-subtype `hdlr`, a `gmhd`
  base-media header (`gmin` + `tmcd > tcmi`), and a `tmcd` `stsd`
  carrying the timing fields. Each `MuxSample` is a 4-byte packed
  timecode payload built with `Tmcd::encode_sample` (counter or
  `[H:M:S:F]` record). Round-trips onto `Track::gmhd` / the `tmcd`
  sample description / `timecode_sample`; with a media track's
  `tref/tmcd` it resolves via `start_timecode`. (Serialisers
  `Tmcd::to_sample_description_body` / `Tcmi::to_body_bytes` /
  `Gmin::to_body_bytes` are the read-side inverses.)
- `MuxTrackKind::Text { description }` writes a QuickTime text track
  (the chapter-track carrier, QTFF pp. 108–110): a `text`-subtype
  `hdlr`, a `gmhd` header (`gmin` + identity-matrix `text`), and a
  `text` `stsd` (`TextSampleDescription::to_body_bytes`). Each
  `MuxSample` is a `[length:u16][UTF-8 text]` record from
  `encode_text_sample`. With a media track's `tref/chap` the titles
  resolve through `MovDemuxer::chapters_for` (DTS-keyed start + duration,
  Unicode and `encd` encoding preserved).
- `MuxTrackKind::Metadata { description }` writes an ISO BMFF timed-
  metadata track (ISO/IEC 14496-12 §12.3): a `meta`-subtype `hdlr`, an
  `nmhd` Null Media Header Box (§8.4.5.2), and a `stsd` whose single
  entry is a `metx` / `mett` / `urim` `MetadataSampleEntry` (the FourCC
  comes from the variant). New `MetadataSampleEntry::to_body_bytes` (+
  per-variant `XmlMetadataSampleEntry` / `TextMetadataSampleEntry` /
  `UriMetadataSampleEntry` / `BitRate` serialisers) are the exact
  inverses of `parse_metx` / `parse_mett` / `parse_urim` / `parse_btrt`,
  framing the `content_encoding` / `namespace` / `schema_location`
  strings, the `txtC` / `uri ` / `uriI` / `btrt` child boxes. Each
  `MuxSample` is the opaque per-sample metadata record. Round-trips onto
  `SampleDescription::metadata` on the non-fragmented and fragmented
  paths; a media track's `tref/cdsc` to it resolves through
  `Track::references`.
- `MuxTrackKind::Subtitle { description }` writes an ISO BMFF subtitle
  track (ISO/IEC 14496-12 §12.6): a `subt`-subtype `hdlr`, an `sthd`
  Subtitle Media Header Box (§12.6.2), and a `stsd` whose single entry
  is a `stpp` (XML, e.g. TTML) or `sbtt` (text) `SubtitleSampleEntry`.
  New `SubtitleSampleEntry::to_body_bytes` / `format` (+ per-variant
  `XmlSubtitleSampleEntry` / `TextSubtitleSampleEntry` serialisers) are
  the exact inverses of `parse_stpp` / `parse_sbtt`, framing the
  `namespace` / `schema_location` / `auxiliary_mime_types` (stpp) or
  `content_encoding` / `mime_format` (sbtt) strings and the `txtC` /
  `btrt` child boxes. Round-trips onto `SampleDescription::subtitle` on
  the non-fragmented and fragmented paths. Distinct from the QuickTime
  `MuxTrackKind::Text` chapter/overlay track.
- `MuxTrackKind::SimpleText { description }` writes an ISO BMFF timed-
  text track (ISO/IEC 14496-12 §12.5): a `text`-subtype `hdlr`, an
  `nmhd` Null Media Header Box (§12.5.2 — timed-text tracks use a null
  media header, *not* the QuickTime `gmhd`), and a `stsd` whose single
  entry is a `stxt` `SimpleTextSampleEntry`. New
  `SimpleTextSampleEntry::to_body_bytes` is the exact inverse of
  `parse_stxt` (`content_encoding` / `mime_format` strings + `txtC` /
  `btrt` child boxes). Round-trips onto `SampleDescription::simple_text`
  on the non-fragmented and fragmented paths; the `stxt`/`nmhd` shape
  distinguishes it from the QuickTime `MuxTrackKind::Text` track
  (`text`/`gmhd`) — the demuxer disambiguates by the `stsd` FourCC.
- `MuxTrackKind::Hint { protocol, description, hmhd }` writes an ISO BMFF
  hint track (ISO/IEC 14496-12 §12.4), a streaming-server packetization
  track: a `hint`-subtype `hdlr`, an `hmhd` Hint Media Header Box
  (§12.4.2 — max/avg PDU size + bitrate, via the new
  `Hmhd::to_body_bytes`), and a `stsd` whose single entry is a
  protocol-named HintSampleEntry (§12.4.3 — FourCC = `protocol`
  identifier such as `rtp `, body = opaque protocol declarative data).
  The opaque `description` body round-trips onto `SampleDescription::extra`
  and the header onto `Track::hmhd`; a `tref/hint` to the packetized
  media track resolves through `Track::references`. Honoured on the
  non-fragmented and fragmented paths.
- `set_track_language(track_id, packed)` sets `mdhd.language` (pack a
  three-letter ISO-639-2 code with `MovMetadata::iso_language`; default
  `MDHD_LANGUAGE_UND` = `"und"`), and `set_track_extended_language(
  track_id, "en-US")` emits an `elng` Extended Language Tag Box (BCP 47;
  empty string clears it). Both round-trip onto `Track::mdhd.language` /
  `Track::extended_language`.
- `set_track_aperture(track_id, Tapt)` emits a `tapt` (Track Aperture
  Modes box) on a video track, carrying whichever of `clef` (Clean
  Aperture) / `prof` (Production Aperture) / `enof` (Encoded Pixels)
  rectangles are populated (`TaptDims::from_pixels` / `to_body_bytes`,
  16.16 fixed-point). Round-trips through `parse_tapt` onto
  `Track::tapt`; non-video tracks and an empty `Tapt` are rejected.
- `set_data_references(track_id, &[DataReferenceWrite])` replaces a
  track's default single self-referencing `dref` (`url ` flags=1) with
  an explicit table — `DataReferenceWrite::{SelfRef, Url, Urn}` — to
  declare external `url ` / `urn ` storage. At most one `SelfRef`: a
  track whose bytes land in this file's `mdat` needs exactly one (the
  muxer points every sample entry's `data_reference_index` at it,
  validated at encode time), while a table with none pairs with
  `set_external_media`. Round-trips through `parse_dref` onto
  `Track::data_references`.
- `set_external_media(track_id, dref_index, &[ExternalSampleLocation])`
  authors an **external-data track** (QTFF "Defining Media Data
  Layouts"): none of its sample bytes are written into this file's
  `mdat` — samples are added with empty `data` (timing / keyframe /
  ctts axes only) and each `ExternalSampleLocation { offset, size }`
  places one sample inside the external file the designated non-self
  `dref` entry names. Byte-contiguous locations coalesce into
  multi-sample chunks (compact run-length `stsc`); `stco` carries the
  external offsets verbatim, auto-promoting to `co64` past 4 GiB;
  `stsz` / `stz2` sizes come from the locations. Composes with both
  `MoovPlacement`s, interleaving (external tracks are excluded — they
  have no bytes here to interleave), `cmov`, edit lists, **and the
  fragmented path** (per §8.8.4.1 a fragmented presentation may keep
  its media in other files): an external track's `traf` carries an
  explicit `tfhd` `base_data_offset` into the external file
  (§8.8.7.1 — anchored at the fragment's lowest location offset) plus
  one `trun` per byte-contiguous location run, local tracks keep
  `default-base-is-moof`, and a fragment whose locations spread past
  `i32::MAX` bytes is rejected (signed `trun.data_offset`, §8.8.8.2).
  Rejected alongside `set_sample_aux`. The read-side counterpart is
  `set_data_reference_opener`; a self-contained and an external
  authoring of the same media present identical packet streams once
  resolved, fragmented or not.
- `set_track_gmin(track_id, Gmin)` overrides the `gmhd/gmin` Generic
  Media Information header (QTFF p. 65) of a time-code / text track —
  the compositing `graphics_mode` (Table 4-2), the `opcolor` triple the
  blend / transparent modes consult, and the stereo `balance` (8.8
  fixed-point). `set_text_header_matrix(track_id, [i32; 9])` overrides
  the `gmhd/text` transformation matrix (QTFF p. 144) of a text track
  (`tkhd`-convention 16.16 / 2.30 fixed-point). Defaults stay the copy
  graphics mode + centred balance + identity matrix; both overrides
  round-trip through `parse_gmin` / `parse_text_header` onto
  `Track::gmhd`. Rejected on a video / audio track (no `gmhd`) and, for
  the matrix, on a non-text track.
- `set_compact_sample_size(track_id, true)` opts a track into emitting
  its sample-size table as a Compact Sample Size Box (`stz2`, ISO/IEC
  14496-12 §8.7.3.3) with the narrowest 4 / 8-bit `field_size` that fits
  every sample, instead of the default 32-bit `stsz`. Transparently
  falls back to `stsz` when that would be smaller (uniform sizes — a
  table-less `stsz` — or any size above 8 bits), so enabling it is always
  safe. Both forms round-trip onto the same per-sample sizes; the
  read-side `MovDemuxer::sample_size_source` reports which box (and the
  `stz2` `field_size`) carried them.
- Per-sample auxiliary sample-table boxes (`stbl` scope, written after
  the chunk-offset table): `set_sample_dependencies(track_id,
  &[SdtpEntry])` writes the Independent and Disposable Samples Box
  (`sdtp`, §8.6.4) one packed dependency byte per sample (`SdtpEntry::
  to_byte`, the inverse of `from_byte`); `set_degradation_priorities(
  track_id, &[u16])` writes the Degradation Priority Box (`stdp`,
  §8.5.3); `set_padding_bits(track_id, &[u8])` writes the Padding Bits
  Box (`padb`, §8.7.6, two 3-bit rows per byte, values `0..=7`);
  `set_shadow_sync_samples(track_id, &[StshEntry])` writes the Shadow
  Sync Sample Box (`stsh`, §8.6.3, auto-sorted ascending by
  `shadowed_sample_number`); and `set_sub_samples(track_id,
  &[SubSampleInfo])` writes the Sub-Sample Information Box (`subs`,
  §8.7.7, sparse rows sorted + delta-coded, auto-promoting to version 1
  when a sub-sample exceeds 65535 bytes). None carries an on-disk count
  field — each table's length is validated against the track's sample
  count — and all round-trip through `parse_sdtp` / `parse_stdp` /
  `parse_padb` / `parse_stsh` / `parse_subs` back onto
  `Track::sample_table`.
- `set_track_load_settings(track_id, Some(Load))` emits a `load` (Track
  Load Settings atom, QTFF pp. 48–49) as an early `trak` child carrying
  the movie-timescale preload window (`preload_start_time` /
  `preload_duration`, `0xFFFF_FFFF` = to-end) plus the preload-mode
  (`LOAD_PRELOAD_ALWAYS` / `_IF_ENABLED`) and quality-hint
  (`LOAD_HINT_DOUBLE_BUFFER` / `_HIGH_QUALITY`) bitfields. `Load::
  to_body_bytes` is the inverse of `parse_load` (a non-FullBox 16-byte
  body). QuickTime-only; round-trips onto `Track::load`.
- `set_track_clipping(track_id, Some(Clipping))` emits a `clip` > `crgn`
  (Track Clipping atom, QTFF pp. 43–44) as a `trak` child carrying the
  QuickDraw clipping region — a signed-16-bit `QdRect` bounding box plus
  an optional opaque scanline mask. `Clipping::to_body_bytes` /
  `ClippingRegion::to_body_bytes` are the inverses of `parse_clip` /
  `parse_crgn` (the `crgn` `region_size` is recomputed);
  `ClippingRegion::rectangular(QdRect)` builds the minimum region.
  QuickTime-only; round-trips onto `Track::clipping`.
- `set_track_matte(track_id, Some(Matte))` emits a `matt` > `kmat`
  (Track Matte atom, QTFF pp. 44–45) as a `trak` child carrying a coded
  blend matte — a FullBox header, a QTFF image description naming the
  codec, and the compressed matte data. `Matte::to_body_bytes` /
  `CompressedMatte::to_body_bytes` are the inverses of `parse_matt` /
  `parse_kmat`. QuickTime-only; round-trips onto `Track::matte`.
- `set_track_kinds(track_id, &[KindEntry])` emits ISO BMFF Track Kind
  boxes (`kind`, §8.10.4) into the track-level `udta` — one per
  `(schemeURI, value)` role pair (WebVTT / DASH subtitle roles), `Zero
  or more` per track. `KindEntry::to_body_bytes` is the inverse of
  `parse_kind`. The track `udta` carries metadata + kinds together;
  round-trips onto `Track::kinds`.
- `set_track_selection(track_id, Some(TrackSelection))` emits an ISO
  BMFF Track Selection box (`tsel`, §8.10.3) into the track-level `udta`
  — the `switch_group` plus differentiating/descriptive attribute
  FourCCs (`TSEL_ATTR_*`) that group tracks for adaptive switching.
  `TrackSelection::to_body_bytes` is the inverse of `parse_tsel`;
  coexists with metadata + `kind` in one `udta`; round-trips onto
  `Track::track_selection`.
- `set_track_groups(track_id, &[TrackGroupTypeEntry])` emits an ISO BMFF
  Track Group box (`trgr`, §8.3.4) as a `trak` child — one framed
  `TrackGroupTypeBox` per membership entry; tracks sharing a
  `(track_group_type, track_group_id)` pair are one group
  (`TrackGroupTypeEntry::msrc(id)` for the base-spec source group).
  `to_body_bytes` / `to_framed_atom` invert `parse_track_group_type` /
  `parse_trgr`; round-trips onto `Track::track_groups`.
- `set_sound_description_v1(track_id, SoundV1, vbr)` writes a QTFF
  `SoundDescriptionV1` (p. 101) audio entry — version 1 with the four
  fixed-compression-ratio longs, `vbr` selecting the p. 102 VBR "third
  variant" (Compression ID `-2`). `set_sound_description_v2(track_id,
  AudioEntryV2)` writes the QuickTime-7 high-resolution
  `SoundDescriptionV2` (QTFF 2012-08-14 pp. 181–182): the `always*`
  back-compatibility constants, `sizeOfStructOnly` = 72, Float64
  `audioSampleRate` (rates past 65535 Hz and non-integer rates
  survive bit-exact), channel count widened to 32 bits, and the
  `LpcmFlags` / const-descriptor words — use it for `lpcm` and >2-
  channel layouts. `set_audio_entry_v1(track_id,
  AudioEntryV1)` instead writes an ISO BMFF `AudioSampleEntryV1`
  (§12.2.3.2): `entry_version` 1, the `stsd` auto-promoted to FullBox
  version 1, plus optional `srat` / `chnl` boxes
  (`ChannelLayout::to_body_bytes` inverting `parse_chnl`). All three
  mutually exclusive, audio-only, explicit channel layouts validated
  against the channel count; all honoured on the fragmented path.
- `set_movie_matrix(Some([i32; 9]))` overrides the `mvhd` movie
  display matrix (identity by default), and `set_movie_preview` /
  `set_movie_poster_time` / `set_movie_selection` /
  `set_movie_current_time` fill the six QuickTime `mvhd` time fields
  (QTFF pp. 33–34). Round-trip onto `Mvhd`; honoured on the
  fragmented init `moov` too.
- Per-track `tkhd` overrides (QTFF p. 42): `set_track_matrix`
  (rotated-recording display matrix), `set_track_layer`
  (compositing order), `set_track_alternate_group` (pairs with
  `tsel`), `set_track_volume` (8.8 fixed-point), and
  `set_track_flags` (enabled / in-movie / in-preview / in-poster —
  a disabled track drops out of `presentation_tracks()`). All
  round-trip onto `Tkhd` and hold on the fragmented init path.
- `with_compressed_movie_resource()` (opt-in) compresses the trailing
  `moov` into a `cmov` tree; `mdat` is written first so chunk offsets
  stay absolute.

## HEIF / HEIC / AVIF

Not here. Item-based still images (ISO BMFF §8.11 `meta` with `pitm` /
`iinf` / `iloc` / `iref` / `iprp`, MIAF properties, `grid` / `iovl` /
`iden` / `tmap` derivations, the `.heic` / `.avif` writer) are owned by
[`oxideav-heif`](https://crates.io/crates/oxideav-heif) — `HeifFile`
for reading, `HeifWriter` for writing. This crate's probe never claims
a HEIF-family brand (`mif1` / `heic` / `heix` / `avif` / `avis` /
`msf1`), and an item-based `meta` met inside a `.mov` is skipped: the
QuickTime `meta` surface is the Apple `keys` / `ilst` shape only.

## Robustness

The walker is injection-hardened for network-supplied input:

- `read_payload` refuses to allocate above
  [`MAX_INMEMORY_ATOM_BODY`] (64 MiB); `mdat` is never read this way
  (per-sample reads `seek` into it). Count-driven parsers
  (`stsd`, `keys`, `chan`, `dref`, `sgpd`, …) reject any declared
  count whose minimum on-disk footprint exceeds the remaining body
  before allocating.
- Top-level and nested atoms whose declared `size` extends past EOF,
  or whose `start + size` overflows `u64`, are rejected at the header.

Pinned by synthetic robustness test suites (forged sizes, truncation
sweeps, random-byte fuzz, extended-size overflow).

## Fuzzing

A `cargo-fuzz` harness under `fuzz/` (target `demux`) feeds arbitrary
bytes through `MovDemuxer::open`, drains up to 256 packets, touches
every file-scope and per-track accessor, exercises the edit-list
mapper at boundary PTS values, re-runs the seek path, then flips on
the applied edit-list mode for a second drain + edited-seek pass
(probing `edited_pts_to_media_pts` at boundary values), and a third
pass with discard emission on (`emit_never_presented`) plus the
typed elst summary accessors, and a fourth pass that attaches an
always-failing data-reference opener (never touching filesystem or
network) so the external-media resolution + sticky-failure cache face
hostile `dref` tables. Alias
resolution is excluded so a fuzz input can't reach the network or
filesystem. A daily 30-minute run is scheduled.

## Standalone build

`oxideav-core` is gated behind the default-on `registry` cargo
feature. Drop the framework dependency with:

```toml
oxideav-mov = { version = "0.0", default-features = false }
```

The parser API (`atom`, `header`, `sample_table`, `track`) stays
available against a crate-local `Error`/`Result`; the `Demuxer`
trait impl and `register()` entry point disappear.

## License

MIT — see `LICENSE` — except the grouping of QuickTime sound samples into
packets (`src/sound_chunks.rs`), ported from FFmpeg and LGPL-2.1-or-later
(see `LICENSE-LGPL`); the crate as a whole is `MIT AND LGPL-2.1-or-later`.
